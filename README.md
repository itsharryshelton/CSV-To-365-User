# ðŸ”£ Automatic 365 User Creation via CSV
### Latest Version: v1.2

This was something I needed for a work job, so putting here if anyone needs it. 

--------------------------------------------------------

Currently, this will take a CSV File with the below columns:

_"Preferred First Name"_

_"Preferred Last Name"_

_"Preferred Email (subject to availability)"_

_"Employee Type"_ (This one gets converted to Department in 365)

_"Job Title"_

Convert it to a clean CSV file for 365, then enter it into 365 for user creation - it does not do any license changes, as wasn't required here.
It will export a CSV file of passwords for each user, with reset on next sign on set.

_Looking to have this pull this info from a TXT so you can customize the bad CSV file easier than editing the code on the next version maybe_

---------------------------------------------------------

# ðŸ“– The way it'll work through:

GUI Box will open, select the function you want to run, either cleaning CSV or just 365 making.
Terminal Box within the GUI so you can see the output as it goes on.
